o transactions
    they are implemented as expected from the document given.
    For example, when a transaction begins, the update is 
    expected to be input and when reading through the input
    if the lock is already present then the transaction aborts
    upon trying to commit. Otherwise, the lock will start from
    that point on. 
o the lock
    the lock is implemented by placing a file that has the same
    name but afterwards there is a "locker" suffix. Then in the 
    program, I use std::filesystem::exists() to look for the 
    locker before performing any changes to the document.
